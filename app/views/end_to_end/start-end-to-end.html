        <p class="lede">Use this service to challenge decisions by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
        <p>The tribunal is <strong>independent of government</strong> and will listen to both sides of the argument before making a decision.</p>
        <p>For more information see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal/overview">guide to tax tribunals and fees</a>.</p>
        <p>You can make an appeal to the tax tribunal by following each step below.</p>

            <p><strong>Find out how much your appeal costs</strong> (about 5 minutes to complete)</p>
            <details>
              <summary>You will need to pay a fee of £20, £50 or £200 to submit an appeal unless you're eligible for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a>.</summary>

              <div class="panel">
                <p>The initial fee to submit your appeal depends on your type of case.</p>
                <p>You may also have to pay further fees if your case needs needs further documents, correspondence and a hearing in person with a judge.</p>
                <p>The judge has the power to decide whether HMRC should reimburse your fees when they look at your case. The tribunal itself does not have the power to enforce or award costs.</p>
                <p>Check if you're able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">get help paying your fees</a> if you’re on a low income or receiving certain benefits.</p>
