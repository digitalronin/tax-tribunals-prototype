      <p class="lede">You have the choice whether to appeal directly to HMRC first, or continue with your appeal to the independent tax tribunal. 
      <p>
      <h2>
      It is free to appeal to HMRC 
      </h2>
      <p>
      You must contact HMRC within the deadline shown on the original notice letter from HMRC. This is usually <strong>30 days</strong>, although you can still appeal late if there are good reasons
      </p>
      <p>
      There is no fee to pay to appeal directly to HMRC. You will usually have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or professional advice.
      </p>
      <h2>
      You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after a direct appeal to HMRC
      </h2>
      <p>
      HMRC will send you a decision letter telling you the outcome of your appeal. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can ask HMRC for a review or make an appeal to an independent tax tribunal within 30 days .
