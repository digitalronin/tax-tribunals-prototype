      <p class="lede">You can challenge the decision with HMRC directly for free.</p>
      <p>
        You must contact HMRC within the deadline shown on the original notice letter from HMRC. This is usually <strong>30 days</strong>, although you can still ask for a review if there are good reasons for being late.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no fee to pay to challenge the decision directly with HMRC. You will only have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or legal advice.
      </p>
      <strong>
        You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after a review
      </strong>
    
      <p>
        HMRC will send you a decision letter telling you the result of the review.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you disagree with the response from HMRC or cannot find a way to resolve the dispute directly with them, you can appeal to an independent tax tribunal. This is usually 30 days from the date you received the last decision letter from HMRC.

          <ul>
            <li>- ask HMRC for a review of the decision by an officer who wasn’t involved in the original decision (you can still apply to the tax tribunal afterwards if you do not accept the review findings)</li>
            <li>- consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</li>
            <li>- appeal to an independent tax tribunal within 30 days</li>
          </ul>
