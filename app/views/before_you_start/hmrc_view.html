        <div class="panel">
          <p>HMRC will clearly tell you on the original notice letter sent to you how you can query or appeal against a tax decision.</p>
          <p>You normally have 30 days to appeal.</p>
          <p>It is free to appeal directly to HMRC. You will usually have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or professional advice.</p>
          <p><strong>You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after an  appeal to HMRC</strong>
          <p>HMRC will send you a decision letter telling you the outcome of your appeal.</p>
          <p>If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can:
          <ul>
            <li>ask HMRC for a review of the decision by an officer who wasn’t involved in the original decision (you can still apply to the tax tribunal afterwards if you do not accept the review findings)</li>
            <li>consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</li>
            <li>appeal to an independent tax tribunal within 30 days</li>
          </ul>
          <p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals">guidance from HMRC on how to appeal</a> against a tax decision.</p>
